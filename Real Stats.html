        <h1>Real Stats</h1> 
        <p><span class="tab"></span>
            "Real Stats" was a project created as part of the Coughacks Hack-a-Thon, where I, a junior at the time, teamed up with four other student programmers. 
            We had just 24 hours to come up with a prototype, design the project, document our work, and present a functional software to a panel of judges. 
            The catch was that we had to follow a theme that was revealed to us at the opening ceremony.
        </p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>  
            Despite the time constraints and some missing features, we managed to secure second place in the teams category.
            Since the Hack-a-Thon, we haven't made any further progress on the project. However, this experience exposed me to every aspect of software engineering,
            including development, teamwork, testing, and problem-solving. It was like going through an entire software development cycle in just 24 hours.
